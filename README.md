# Empty State RecyclerView
*Updates to docs and repository are still in progress*

A highly customizable subclass of RecyclerView that draws state displays for loading and empty content states.

Easily allows you to handle displaying stateful information (like content is loading, content is empty, content loading had failed, or content loaded ok) to the user in a fun and awesome way!
